# FZManager
FZManager is new version of <a href="https://gitlab.com/nvx0/fz-utility">FZUtility</a> and a more advanced tool than before.

## What does it change? What have been added?
First of all FZUtility is now FZManager, it now includes features as:
- Completly new and redesigned UI (not as messy as before)
- Session managing (easier sessionSecret managment, reseting, switching etc.)
- More customization options (custom border rounding, themes such as White/Dark/Amoled)
- More language options such as English, Polish, Russian, German
- Viewing your sessionSecret/visitSecret
- Command hinting (when part of a command is entered it shows potential matches)

And of course, as it was being known for it also includes mass mod uploading.
